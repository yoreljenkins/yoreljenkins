### Hey, I'm Leroy! 👋

---
##### TL;DR 
### Creative front-end developer + designer, with a soft spot for gamedev and animation. Always learning and trying new technologies.

Involved in the development scene since I was 13, creating websites and forums for the gaming scene. I took a detour to persue an education in design and crafts whilst still taking on freelance gigs in the meantime. Since graduating I have been working as a front-end and full-stack developer at several agencies.
